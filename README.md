### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm William!

You can check out [my website (williamw.me)](https://williamuw.github.io "My Personal Website") for a summary of my side projects and other relevant information.

I am in my 2nd year studying CS at Waterloo, and my interests are fixing electronics, monitoring stock prices, and I am a fan of the musical Hamilton.
