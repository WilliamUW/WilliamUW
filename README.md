### Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">, I'm William!

Feel free to check out [my website (williamw.me)](https://williamuw.github.io "My Personal Website") where I showcase my passion for technology as well as a brief summary of my side projects.

I am in my 2A term studying CS at Waterloo, and my interests are fixing electronics, monitoring stock prices, and improving the lives of others through technology!
